This project is to give programmers a platform to help Humanity use programming/Machine Learning to fight with 2019â€“20
coronavirus pandemic.

Two goals:
    1. Predict accurately present state, & study about spread pattern.
    2. Learn about SARS-CoV-2, COVID 19.

Any Language can be used on data in the folder "data"
Research using new language will have a suffix with the language name with "was" and "_" for example was_scala, and
was_scala should be an independednt project

Scala:
    Researches contained in each folder insidesrc/main/scala/
    for example: predictstate/PredictDeathConfirmedRecovered
    It contains: output data and readme file: contains all the detail.


For other languages, same structure can be follwed.
Let the data be in the parent data folder which can be used by all languages, output of one can be put in the test
folder itself, which can be used by another research.

Data (can also be updated with commits) Sources:
